Hackathon Challenge

Hackathon Challenge Title:
Bridging Rwanda’s Digital Skills Gap with AI

Challenge Overview:
Rwanda is making progress in digital upskilling, but two major gaps remain:

a. Misalignment with Industry Needs
While Rwanda has made commendable progress in digital skills training through national programs and partnerships, there is still a disconnect between what is taught and what is demanded by employers.

Outdated training content: Some programs do not incorporate emerging areas such as DevOps, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and user experience design.
Overgeneralized curricula: Many training programs offer broad digital literacy or basic coding, but lack depth in specializations that are in demand.
Ineffective certification pathways: Graduates may possess certificates but lack demonstrable, hands-on expertise, leading to underemployment.
“While digital literacy is improving, the depth of technical specialization remains shallow, especially in areas critical for the digital economy.”
 — World Bank, 2025

2. Geographic and Infrastructure Barriers
Despite Rwanda’s efforts to expand digital infrastructure, training and talent development are still largely centered in urban areas, leaving rural populations behind.

Unequal access to training: Most digital training programs are located in Kigali and a few secondary cities, excluding rural youth.
Connectivity and affordability issues: Poor internet access and high data costs limit participation in online learning, particularly outside urban centers.
Outcome: Rural populations are underrepresented in the digital workforce, exacerbating inequality and slowing nationwide digital transformation.
“Infrastructure constraints still prevent full participation of rural populations in digital skills programs.”

Your Mission:
Build innovative, AI-powered solutions that make specialized, industry-aligned digital skills accessible to all especially underserved youth.

Your solution should leverage AI to:

Personalize learning based on user goals and industry needs
Bridge the gap between certification and real-world skills
Deliver content in low-bandwidth or offline environments
Help learners showcase practical skills to employers
Create or curate localized, relevant training pathways
What We’re Looking For an Idea with:
Effective use of AI (Showing a prototype is recommended but not a must)
Relevance to Rwanda’s digital skills needs
Inclusiveness (urban + rural learners)
Feasibility and scalability
Innovation & impact potential

Judging Criterias

Pitch Presentation: Friday afternoon at 2:30 pm
Duration: 3–5 minutes

Criterias 
1. Relevance to the Problem
How well does your idea address Rwanda’s digital skills gap?
This means tackling issues like industry misalignment, shallow specialization, or lack of access in rural communities. Be specific and show us why your solution matters.

2. Feasibility & Use of AI
 Is your solution realistic and technically sound?
 We’re not just looking for cool ideas. We want to know:

Can it work in real-life conditions?
Does it use AI meaningfully — not just for show?
Is it suited for low-bandwidth or offline environments?
3. Milestones & Execution
What progress did you make during the hackathon?
Even if your idea is big, we’re interested in what you’ve built or mapped out so far.
Mockups, working prototypes, demos we want to see your execution in action.

4. Innovation & Differentiation
What makes your idea unique?
We’ll be looking for fresh thinking, something that stands apart.
Localization, creative use of data, or new learning pathways are great examples.

5. Scalability & Impact Potential
Can your idea grow and make a real difference?
We’re looking for projects that could work beyond Kigali, reach rural areas, and be sustainable. Think partnerships, accessibility, and long-term value.

6. Team Capacity
Do you have the right mix of skills and understanding?
We’ll assess how well your team works together and if you’re positioned to keep developing the idea post-hackathon.

7. Presentation & Communication
Did you clearly communicate your problem, solution, and impact?
 A strong pitch helps everyone understand your idea, your progress, and your potential.

Scoring
Each category will be scored from 1 to 5:

1 = Poor, major gaps
3 = Solid, meets expectations
5 = Outstanding, ready to grow
We’ll also be looking at:

How well you support your idea with real evidence or research
And how much your team could benefit from funding or mentorship at this stage
