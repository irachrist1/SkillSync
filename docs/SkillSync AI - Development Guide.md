# SkillSync AI - Complete Development Guide

## Research & Feasibility

**Core Insight:** 70% of jobs in Rwanda require digital skills, but there's a massive disconnect between what people learn and what employers actually need. Current solutions are either too generic (global platforms) or too basic (certificate programs without job market alignment).

**What We're Building:** A Skills-to-Jobs Matcher that connects current skills directly to Rwanda job opportunities, then generates personalized learning paths to unlock better career outcomes. This isn't another course platform - it's career intelligence for Rwanda's job market.

### Pre-Development Research Required:
- Investigate Rwanda's actual digital job market (kLab, SOLVIT Africa, current job postings)
- Research successful career platform UX patterns and data visualization approaches
- Analyze what skills actually correlate with employment success in Rwanda specifically
- Study advanced AI prompting techniques for structured career analysis

## Essential Features

### MVP Features (Core Value)
- **Current Skills Input:** Intelligent interface to select/add technical and digital skills
- **Job Market Reality Check:** Shows actual jobs qualified for today in Rwanda with salary ranges
- **Next-Level Opportunities:** AI identifies 1-2 specific skills that unlock 2x better job opportunities
- **Learning Resource Finder:** Provides specific, actionable learning resources for recommended skills
- **Skills Impact Calculator:** Shows salary/opportunity improvement from adding each skill

### Differentiating Features
- **Rwanda Job Market Data:** Real local employment data, not generic global content
- **Opportunity Cost Analysis:** Shows exactly how much earning potential you're missing
- **Skill Investment ROI:** Ranks skill learning by time investment vs. job market impact
- **Immediate vs. Future Path:** Separates "get a job now" from "get a better job in 6 months"
